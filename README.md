# 📊 CodeAccountant (Archived)

**CodeAccountant** is an early, ambitious attempt to treat source code as something that can be **understood, executed, measured, and accounted for** — across multiple programming languages.

This project is archived and preserved as an **origin project** that later gave rise to smaller, more focused tools.

---

## 🚀 What was the idea?

CodeAccountant started with a big question:

> “What if code execution wasn’t just ‘run and forget’, but something we could track, analyze, and reason about?”

The goal was to build a system that could:
- detect and understand code
- execute it safely
- capture results
- log and persist outcomes
- provide insight over time

---

## 🧠 Core concepts

- 🧩 **Language-aware execution**
  - Identify the programming language
  - Route execution through appropriate toolchains
- ⚙️ **Compile & run pipelines**
  - Separate build and execution stages
  - Capture outputs and exit status
- 📊 **Execution accounting**
  - Logs as structured data
  - Historical records of runs
  - Repeatability and traceability
- 🧾 **Project vs file awareness**
  - Not just scripts — but code as an artifact

---

## 🧬 Why this project matters

This repository represents a **conceptual foundation**, not a finished product.

During development, it became clear that the scope was too large to tackle all at once. As a result:

- A focused execution slice was extracted → **CodeBuilder**
- Other ideas were intentionally paused
- The core concepts lived on and evolved elsewhere

This repo preserves that original vision.

## 🗂️ Project status

**Archived / Exploratory Prototype**

- Incomplete by design
- Over-scoped for a single developer
- No production guarantees
- No active maintenance

This is a snapshot of *ideas in motion*, not a polished tool.

---

## 💡 Lessons learned (and carried forward)

- Big systems need thin vertical slices
- Execution tooling benefits from strict boundaries
- “Understanding code” is a different problem from “running code”
- Logging and accounting deserve first-class status

These lessons directly informed later projects.

---

## 🔮 If revived today…

A modern revival would likely involve:
- containerized execution
- AST-based language analysis
- structured execution databases
- sandboxing and security models
- clear separation between execution and analysis

## 🏷️ Status

**Archived — foundational and aspirational.**

This project represents the earliest roots of a longer tool-building journey.
